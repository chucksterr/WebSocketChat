# WebSocketChat: STOMP & SPRING BOOT
Spring boot chat

I DO NOT OWN THIS CODE... IT IS A TUTORIAL THAT I FOLLOWED, I HAVE HOWEVER SPENT SOME TIME UNDERSTANDING ROUGHLY EVERY LINE OF CODE.

I STARTED LEARNING JAVA 2 AND A HALF MONTHS AGO AND SPRING BOOT 2 WEEKS AGO. I UNDERSTAND HOW CHALLENGING IT CAN BE TO MAKE 

SENSE OF TUTORIALS SO, I HAVE CREATED A PACKAGE CALLED DOCUMENTATION. 

THE TEXT FILE : "documentation.txt" LAYS DOWN THE ORDER IN WHICH EACH FILE WAS CREATED. THEN EACH JAVA CLASS HAS A CORRESPONDING

TEXT FILE THE THE DOCUMENTATION PACKAGE EXPLAINING WHAT EACH METHODS DOES MORE OR LESS LINE BY LINE.
I
I ONLY HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION FOR MAIN.JS TO COMPLETE... I WILL NOT PREPARE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE CSS OR HTML...

ON A PERSONAL NOTE : I have consulted a ton of free resources to make my code work... we have an amazing online community to support 
us, beginners / junior developers. When consulting those pages, please disable your AD Blockers.

We all know there are costs associated with hosting. And yet they upload it free of charge, so help those amazing teachers out... 
Please don't be selfish and let their work support itself through ads. 
(No matter how annoying they can be)
