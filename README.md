# WebSocketChat: STOMP & SPRING BOOT
Spring boot chat

I DO NOT OWN THIS CODE... IT IS A MASH UP OF SEVERAL TUTORIALS THAT I FOLLOWED! I HAVE HOWEVER SPENT SOME TIME UNDERSTANDING ROUGHLY EVERY LINE OF CODE.

I started learning Java a couple months ago and Spring Boot2 in January 2018. I understand how challenging it can be to make sense of tutorials so, I have created a package called "documentation". 

THE text file : "documentation.txt" lays down the order in which each document was created; then each java class has a corresponding text file in the documentation package explaining what each methods does more or less line by line.

I WILL NOT PREPARE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE CSS OR HTML... but I will refer you to the w3schools website.

ON A PERSONAL NOTE : I have consulted a ton of free resources to make my code work... we have an amazing online community to support 
us, beginners / junior developers. When consulting those pages, please disable your AD Blockers.

I would like to point out that there are costs associated with hosting. And yet they upload their content free of charges, so help those amazing teachers out... Please don't be selfish and let their work support itself through ads. (No matter how annoying they can be)
